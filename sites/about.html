        <img src="/assets/images/Sommerfeld.jpg" alt="that is me">
        <p>I am a M.Sc. Data Science student. I consider myself an alrouder. I have worked on different kinds of projects in different domains. I am always eager to learn, and not afraid to do so. Further Computers fascinate me. 
            I appreciate their power and like to examine the boundaries of the current technical possibilities.</p>
