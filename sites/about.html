        <p class="intro">I am a M.Sc. Data Science student. I consider myself an alrouder. I have worked on different kinds of projects in different domains. I am always eager to learn, and not afraid to do so. Computers fascinate me. 
            I appreciate their power and like to examine the boundaries of the current technical possibilities.
        </p>
        <p class="sub_intro">As you can see from my website I am certainly not a webdeveloper. However, I think it is a good example of my attitude:
            Always try to do new things and understand the essential elements of them. When you are interested in a dense presentation of my acadamic and professional path, then please take a look at my resume that is attached as pdf download below.
            If you are interested in a more fun and deeper look into my personal development please check the various <a href="/sites/blog.html">blog entries</a> I wrote regarding elements of my resume and projects that dont fit on there.
