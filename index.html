        <p> 
            My name is Marius Sommerfeld and 
            I am striving to become a data scientist. Although this is my main interest I always take on fun projects that might match my profile but also some that are different but catch my interest.
            You can find my professional history in the <a href="/sites/about.html" class="about-link">About</a> section.
            Further, I present different projects I worked on in a blog form. The most recent posts are displayed hereafter.
