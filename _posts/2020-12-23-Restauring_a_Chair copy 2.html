    <p> For the winter holydays I approached a fun project with my mother:<!--more-->
        The restauration of an old chair that was left in my student apartment when I moved in.
        The general design of the chair was very nice but the overall condition of the chair was lets say fair.

        We first detached the seat and back parts from the wooden frame. Then we started to remove 
        the old aritfical leather from the seat and back pad. This was followed by cutting an old carpet into the right size and 
        carefully fixing it back to the wooden plates that is the basis of the pad. This was done by tretching the carpet fabric 
        and fixing it using a stapler. This was not easy to get right without the fabric showing crinkles and really needed to persons, 
        so someone to strech and the other one to fix the fabric using the stapler. So now the pad's are done it was time to tackle the 
        frame of the chair. I started to remove paint stains and other unregularities using sanding paper. When doing this it is 
        important to start with coarse paper frirst and then move to more fine paper. This took some time and created a lot of 
        dust but eventually I was happy with the result and removed the remaining dust on the chair using a brush and and a wet cloth. 
        Finally i could start to bring a first layer of oil on the chair. Afterwards i added a second layer of oil givin the chair the nice 
        finish you can see in the pictures. The only thing left was to attach the pads back to the frame and voila I am a prouf owner of a
         beautiful restaurated chair.
